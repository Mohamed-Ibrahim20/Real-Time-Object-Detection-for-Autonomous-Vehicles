# Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles

## Project Overview

The **Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles** project focuses on building a machine learning model capable of detecting and classifying objects in the environment (pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, obstacles) in real-time. This model will be deployed in autonomous vehicle systems to enhance safety and decision-making during driving.

The project addresses challenges such as detecting objects in varying environmental conditions (lighting, road types, and weather), ensuring safety in real-time driving scenarios, and integrating the model into an operational autonomous vehicle system.
